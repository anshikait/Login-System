Secure Login System
This project was developed as part of the MITS Internship Program. 
It focuses on building a robust and secure user authentication system with features such as user registration, login, password hashing, and session management. 
The goal was to implement best practices in authentication and data protection while ensuring a smooth user experience. 

This project helped strengthen my understanding of backend security, database integration, and API development.
